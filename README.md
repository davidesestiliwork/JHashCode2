The program allows you to generate the hashes with the chosen algorithm (MD2, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512) of a single file or an entire folder (you can choose to scan the folder recursively or not recursively). It supports drag and drop of files and folders. The hash can be exported to text files.

Java Runtime 6 or higher is required.
